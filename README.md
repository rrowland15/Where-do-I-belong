This project integrates real estate market data with county-level well-being metrics to identify clusters of similar counties. 
Using these clusters, a user-facing form collects individual preferences across well-being factors and budget constraints, then matches users to counties that best align with their priorities. 
Results are visualized using interactive D3.js choropleth maps, enabling users to explore geographic patterns and compare potential locations. 
The tool was designed to support remote workers in discovering places to live based on lifestyle and cost considerations.
